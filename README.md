# World Happiness Report Data Analysis

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the World Happiness Report dataset, which is a comprehensive survey of global happiness levels. The dataset contains information about happiness scores and rankings for various countries, along with factors that contribute to happiness such as economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. The analysis aims to uncover insights regarding the happiest (and least happy) countries, factors influencing happiness, changes in rankings over time, and significant variations in happiness levels.

## Background
The World Happiness Report is an influential survey that assesses the state of global happiness and provides insights into the factors influencing well-being on an individual and national level. Governments, organizations, and civil society widely use the happiness indicators to inform policy-making decisions. 

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises five CSV files, each representing a specific year (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019) of the World Happiness Report. These files contain information about happiness scores, country rankings, and the contributing factors for each country. The factors include economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. By merging the datasets, a unified DataFrame named "df" was created for analysis.

## Python Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Skills Demonstrated
This project showcases several essential skills for data analysts, including:
- Data cleaning: The dataset required cleaning and preprocessing to ensure uniformity and eliminate inconsistencies.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Through visualizations and statistical summaries, the project uncovers patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset.
- Data visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn were utilized to create informative and visually appealing charts and graphs.
- Data merging and transformation: The project combines multiple CSV files into a single DataFrame, allowing for comprehensive (time-series) analysis.
- Proficient use of pandas: The project demonstrates expertise in utilizing pandas for data manipulation and analysis tasks.

## Results and Insights
The analysis of the World Happiness Report dataset yielded several valuable insights, including:

1. Identification of the happiest and least happy countries and regions: The analysis unveils countries and regions that are ranked the highest and lowest on the overall happiness scores and certain factors. 
2. Factors contributing to happiness: The project explores the impact of various factors such as economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity on overall happiness.
3. Changes in global happiness over time: By visualising the global happiness score from 2015 to 2019, the project identifies the trend in global happiness. 

## Future Enhancements
These are ideas for future enhancement of this project: 

1. Predictive modelling: Explore the possibility of building a predictive model to forecast future happiness scores based on historical data and factors.
2. Time series analysis: Perform in-depth time series analysis to identify long-term trends and patterns in happiness levels.
3. Interactive visualizations: Utilize interactive visualization libraries like Plotly or Bokeh to create engaging and dynamic charts.
4. Comparative analysis: Compare the World Happiness Report dataset with other relevant datasets to uncover additional insights and correlations.
